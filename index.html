                Beloved French chanson entertainer Charles Aznavour, who wrote more than 800 songs, recorded more than 1,000 of them in
                French, English, German and Spanish and sold over 100 million records in all, was born Shahnour Vaghinag Aznavourian on
                May 22, 1924, in Paris, the younger of two children born to Armenian immigrants who fled to France. His mother was a
                seamstress as well as an actress and his father was a baritone who sang in restaurants. Both Charles and his elder
                sister waited on tables and he performed, as well. He delivered his first poetic recital while just a toddler. Within a
                few years later he had developed such a passion for singing/dancing, that he sold newspapers to earn money for lessons.
                <br>
                <br>
                He took his first theatrical bow in the play "Emil and the Detectives" at age 9 and within a few years was working as a
                movie extra. He eventually quit school and toured France and Belgium as a boy singer/dancer with a traveling theatrical
                troupe while living the bohemian lifestyle. A popular performer at the Paris' Club de la Chanson, it was there that he
                was introduced in 1941 to the songwriter Pierre Roche. Together they developed names for themselves as a singing/writing
                cabaret and concert duo ("Roche and Aznamour"). A Parisian favorite, they became developed successful tours outside of
                France, including Canada. In the post WWII years Charles began appearing in films again, one of them as a singing
                croupier in Goodbye Darling (1946).

                <br>
                Eventually Aznavour earned a sturdy reputation composing street-styled songs for other established musicians and
                singers, notably Édith Piaf, for whom he wrote the French version of the American hit "Jezebel". Heavily encouraged by
                her, he toured with her as both an opening act and lighting man. He lived with Piaf out of need for a time not as one of
                her many paramours. His mentor eventually persuaded him to perform solo (without Roche) and he made several successful
                tours while scoring breakaway hits with the somber chanson songs "Sur ma vie" and "Parce que" and the notable and
                controversial "Après l'amour." In 1950, he gave the bittersweet song "Je Hais Les Dimanches" ["I Hate Sundays"] to
                chanteuse Juliette Gréco, which became a huge hit for her.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the late 50s, Aznavour began to infiltrate films with more relish. Short and stubby in stature and excessively brash
                and brooding in nature, he was hardly leading man material but embraced his shortcomings nevertheless. Unwilling to let
                these faults deter him, he made a strong impressions with the comedy Une gosse 'sensass' (1957) and with Paris Music
                Hall (1957). He was also deeply affecting as the benevolent but despondent and ill-fated mental patient Heurtevent in
                The Keepers (1959). A year later, Aznavour starred as piano player Charlie Kohler/Edouard Saroyan in Francois Truffaut's
                adaptation of the David Goodis' novel Shoot the Pianist (1960) [Shoot the Piano Player], which earned box-office kudos
                both in France and the United States. This sudden notoriety sparked an extensive tour abroad in the 1960s. Dubbed the
                "Frank Sinatra of France" and singing in many languages (French, English, Italian, Spanish, German, Russian, Armenian,
                Portuguese), his touring would include sold-out performances at Carnegie Hall (1964) and London's Albert Hall (1967).
                <br>
                <br>
                Aznavour served as actor and composer/music arranger for many films, including Gosse de Paris (1961), which he also
                co-wrote with director Marcel Martin, and the dramas Three Fables of Love (1962) [Three Fables of Love") and Dear
                Caroline (1968) [Dear Caroline]. The actor also embraced the title role in the TV series "Les Fables de la Fontaine"
                (1964), then starred in the popular musical "Monsieur Carnaval" (1965), in which he performed his hit song "La bohême".
                <br>
                <br>
                His continental star continued to shine and Aznavour acted in films outside of France with more dubious results. While
                the satirical Candy (1968), with an international cast that included Marlon Brando, Richard Burton and Ringo Starr, and
                epic adventure The Adventurers (1970) were considered huge misfires upon release, it still showed Aznavour off as a
                world-wide attraction. While he was also seen in The Games (1970) (1970), The Blockhouse (1973) (1973) and an umpteenth
                film version of Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None (1974), it was his music that kept him in the international
                limelight. Later films included Yiddish Connection (1986), which he co-wrote and provided music; Il maestro (1990) with
                Malcolm McDowell; the Canadian-French production Ararat (2002) for which he received special kudos; cameos as himself in
                The Truth About Charlie (2002) and Emmenez-moi (2005); and his final feature film, The Colonel (2006)
                <br>
                <br>
                Films aside, his chart-busting single "She" (1972-1974) went platinum in Great Britain. He also received thirty-seven
                gold albums in all. His most popular song in America, "Yesterday When I Was Young" has had renditions covered by
                everyone from Shirley Bassey to Julio Iglesias. In 1997, Aznavour received an honorary César Award. He has written three
                books, the memoirs "Aznavour By Aznavour" (1972), the song lyrics collection "Des mots à l'affiche" (1991) and a second
                memoir "Le temps des avants" (2003). A "Farewell Tour" was instigated in 2006 at age 82. He died
                <br>
                <br>
                Married at least three times (some claim five) to Micheline Rugel, Evelyne Plessis and Ulla Thorsell, he fathered six
                children (daughters Katia, Patricia and Seda Aznavour, and sons Misha, Nicholas, and Patrick Aznavour). He died on
                October 1, 2018, in France.
